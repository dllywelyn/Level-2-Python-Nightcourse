###### Make easy, medium and hard modes. Medium = as is
# EASY with added instructions/hints  and a miracle of god:
##(change harvrate to 1-31, <10 = x1, <20 = x2, <30 = x3, ==31 = x10)
### maybe smaller odds? 1-91 split into 30s, 1 - 151 split into 50s, 1-301 split into 100s
#### less migrants, less change of rats (or amount eaten less)
# HARD mode = random floods, again using small odds system above,
## i.e. if disaster == 31/91/151, flood(destory crops), war/disease (kill population #low populatio is good, thnk of something else), fire (destory land)
### maybe more chance of rats?  More migrants, set range higher with min amount guaranteed
